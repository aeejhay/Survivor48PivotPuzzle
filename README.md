🧩Survivor Pivot Puzzle – Project Overview

Survivor Pivot Puzzle is a browser-based interactive puzzle game inspired by the iconic challenges in the Survivor TV series — a show I’ve been a massive fan of since Day 1, from Survivor: Borneo all the way to the present.

This game replicates a real challenge mechanic seen in Survivor USA Season 48, Episode 2, where players must slide, pivot, and reorder number tiles to complete a sequence — testing logic, speed, and patience under pressure.
